Pomodoro clock project through [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/pairing-project). Though planned as a pair project, I completed start to finish solo. 

A [Pomodoro Clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) is a timing system where work is split into timed intervals. For this project, I set up a work timer that counts down from an adjustable time limit, then switches to an adjustable break time, then back to the work timer and so on indefinitely. It includes pause, stop, and refresh buttons.
